  we had a bug in our app which was even i am not loggedIn i was able to go to the Browse page, If Iam logged in and try to go to the home page through URL then it was not redirecting me to the Browse page. so we have this BUG because we are not checking authentication. We have this issue also because we are routing from the parent component and not from the children. Now we have to keep checking authentication from a place which will be in our whole app and also in my routerProvider, here that component is out Header component.

ðŸš© NOTE:while we are building our app and when we make api call we see that our api call is made 2 times, or sometimes most of the things gets called 2 times. This happens because of the STRICT MODE OF REACT.you can see it in index.js
and it only happens in local, it will not happen in your build.
